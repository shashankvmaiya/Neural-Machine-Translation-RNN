So part of <unk> practice is recognizing that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all makes of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you need to take from what would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that the high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart diseases attack the heart of brain.
So one is thinking that having a high cholesterol cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even as likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for most physicians don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not from the doctor, and if it's your fault.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat <unk> more widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?

This is according to the research research research <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke, or another <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to get my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things that include muscle pain and muscle <unk> but now they think, 5 percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress they don't think clearly.
So think of how you do that over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that you help your drug.
I don't say you should or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic requires, is part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that you do in the top men in the top men of the world's prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
They include the helplessness or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky enough and it's one of that 50 percent effects -- only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can argue that we will break the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you shut a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face in face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react fast, they could be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be these <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the door door, an easy way of it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I've not <unk> and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can I ever have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came during the decade of 1800, and over the time of the time, it mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we know today as a <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, according to <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do you understand the sound about.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when they eat a bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb so it doesn't be natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces, and while I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk> more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound for sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that they had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could give it to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the school and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a very temporary form of value -- like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it in <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into many different <unk>
If you break a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you get older, just one key at a time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the building, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I am <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and wears it.
This is <unk>
If you <unk> and <unk> the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express change in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two <unk> the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my personal favorite, with a very romantic idea at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think of it automatically at <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high hands.
Now we're going to do it as much on the head like your chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest -- but they carry very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and <unk> just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have a <unk> it has no social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a wealthy trove and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to introduce you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up the other of others.
Time country, now I'm adult and teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to collect these plastic pieces to study it under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge ingredients.
So along with my students, six to 15 years old, we dream with invent a better way.
We've transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who are using electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are going to get a lot with the robots.
And then we made quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And it would turn the lights and web cameras on accessories.
We see plastic pieces floating through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and the <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to look at my problem with my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are a very good <unk>
You see the news, you see the Internet, and the Internet, and you get bored with this machine.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands -- in <unk> the largest <unk> of the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that they <unk> the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the oil and the oil are also brown color, and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there is in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to look at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe I might tackle a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half a Japanese and French half French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear central power of water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons is still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and most of the time, it has safe and it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research in the basis with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take your work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was <unk> <unk>
But based on this is a civil expedition -- the nearest center of nuclear power until date.
We get to 1.5 miles of nuclear, and with the aid aid we were able to be collecting <unk> <unk> with a tracking tracking tracking as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of small and so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we became the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> power.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard cargo chairs into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as scientists, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel, the other one of a single silk silk show.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is a <unk> on the environment, the other thing I thought about.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> saw a figure that fights for being free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, and we took all the information to do it for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have dictated a world in fact, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects as <unk> from different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores are thin <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk>
It's a system that gets gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, bringing away from the assembly and moving growth.
You're probably wondering why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird, weird moment, where four disciplines offers four disciplines that offers the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, and tools and tools through scales, at scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-hour entry of diameter with a base of a force that one day is not very far to print buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every opening is just the size of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion farm in Paris with <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing collaborator of 3D printing we printed this layer and 3D <unk> without seams between the cells.
This hull combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner here.
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the instruments that are able to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair to the <unk> <unk> and also that it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
So let's take this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the dots in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to other material or other <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree there would be no difference between the trunk, the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made trees growing up with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material to do the kind of material that the tree of the <unk> tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of being produced every year by organisms, and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a bunch of <unk> of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one material for a single material for a long material -- 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are lists, leaves them dry up to find a natural shape in the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> <unk> and if it extends even more, and windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metal <unk> new biological channels within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We had our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human family.
A converts light into sugar, the other carbon takes sugar and produces some useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that relates to the digestive tract that will help us to make these bacteria and that they would save their <unk>
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we had more transparent channels.
This is a <unk> system, when you stretch from one end to another, it goes on 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times more than our <unk> <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are middle-aged creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that make <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we're going to bring our skin, <unk> the vascular tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the ecology material.
So for that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer does material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated social architecture, a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which is <unk> those fibers together.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they show them in a single material.
With the end of the order of understanding how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm of <unk> <unk>
We put it inside of a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm of the worm of silk.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different parts -- and we've figured out that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is used and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates <unk> we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process into architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that tube worms are going to be more dark and more dark and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and the heat of the light and the hot <unk>
We were prepared to get <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they go, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion on integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms, <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other plastic is empty.
If the latest frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings that surround us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by the design of us, which demands of us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they first asked this?
Can you hold your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
They have caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I loved English, the <unk> and the art and he got online sites, and besides, I played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, because we have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to get it.
But then I got it up for something else, something totally different, and I was going to get myself on it, and I'm going to be <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to get it.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to pick up one thing, deny all my other passions, and they would be able to <unk>
Another reason why it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me for not <unk> for anything.
I was concerned with a fear of commitment, or to be awake or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to give you a few then.
They ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where <unk> learned about culture.
We asked first to first ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they were to <unk>
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going to be over and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what gives us the dream.
Why?
So if this question inspires children to dream with what they might be, don't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adult adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, you can't be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he is <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative conductor.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
This idea is this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do during their time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up your curiosity and many different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many creative interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> for it.
It could help if you divide it in three parts: a lot of potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance the ideal was that the ideal was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of <unk> to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned to talk with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths on being this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in our new data, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this whole idea by his <unk> and a full of skills and experiences.
The innovation is happening at intersections.
From that new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning quickly.
When we <unk> it for something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
Many abilities are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> and <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quick <unk>
Before he turned into the writer, he was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales of sales when they were starting their thumb, and this ability to write <unk> <unk> for the editors.
<unk> a loss of time having a loss of time -- even if you would tell you even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. It is to say, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the <unk> of other videos, other websites, sometimes consultant to like Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, it appears James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to deal with to meet the market needs of the market that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're a pressure to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging them to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart.
<unk> off the belly -- knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The leader can dive deep deep and put in practice ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have design lives and careers that are going to deal with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them are being told to be more like your fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart of heart, then you would go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world will tell us.
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> who led to a psychiatric psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, and unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found plates weird and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you had been living today, we could never give it more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I am part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include a lot of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance to get Alzheimer's to almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that they pass their years infected with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be wanted Alzheimer's disease.
It's only in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> a <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what days people know, but everyone else knows, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can get <unk>
For most of the last few <unk> years, all of us, even scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just look at a picture of a healthy old brain compared to the <unk> patient to see the real physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent, it reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots -- they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left in the outside.
This makes the molecules out of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> the others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does.
Until recently, most of the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that deploy specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normality.
These variations on the other hand, have molecules of protein that they stick together with each other than humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope that it can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we manage it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure industry industry and <unk> companies.
That was essential to move forward in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are going to be done to get 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then you both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number two: When was the last time you had another person?
And <unk>
<unk> are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to get to your partner what you like of him or her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say somebody you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I had no <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so that I send it to the neocortical column for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably going to be asking, they still keep up.
And the reason I think the reason I think is this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But one blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper stood up on a Friday night, and already Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the files, Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news.  And that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, the same question: are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were of students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it up.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times ran a <unk> article for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did to make a public onset together.
And we run TV interviews, and they took photos of some of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> <unk> process -- a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether the study worked, they wanted to be able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but love <unk> love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, most of all, that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if you could do it together or not, and they also get <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Rather than that, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between university students, using what they were <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants were closer to doing -- several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community, and they've used it to be used by people in the opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never came published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a <unk> liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would tell you about the person with the person who <unk>
Well he made a program.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> I know they managed to get better to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
He had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to virtually all of my adult life, and he was my first love of real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took up to science.
And I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that could actually be in a certain shape <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I just worked for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand for what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably to demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to be <unk> indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut for <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still still together?
And their content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that let's make questions more difficult, questions like, How do you decide who is worth your love and who doesn't?
So how do you stay in love when things go extinct, and how to cut out when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with doubt in your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's a year ago, a known year ago, and I designed a study designed to create romantic love, and we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love -- because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no thought that I was supposed to do.
I didn't think I would have both to make that decision, and how sometimes I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he always will choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun, and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what we would do, and what maybe I would spend my life looking for is that the myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have on change is a chance of choosing to love somebody, and the hope that he was also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian <unk> and in a way I got as a <unk> of the forest.
New York City a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a ticket of a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species are, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment because I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go out of board and make all those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> the style of Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee left <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I put more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: it somehow seemed to rise to size, as if it was that they were going to take the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding elements of electronic robots, strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow out to draw just like you can draw just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects out and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you might be able to get an idea.
Then I made insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, to go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in human form of resin of natural size with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then the other window, and he had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this was really working, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
By the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with animals in animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, and this <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
Here's where creatures with animals in animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham Is it in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama Bin Laden, there's all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand and the other hand gets out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a peak of a bird and spitting out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail strikes by <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up as well.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made out of terrorist cards.
Have you <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk>
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, and it can be <unk>
I will accompany you over the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick role of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a school, an editorial arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
And we took the box and all of the people in the inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we came up to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of the countries, of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill actually has an effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is going to be made in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a great problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the count of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on top of their side effects on top of it, because in the time that it takes to get to your blood current they will be <unk> and even for the time that it takes to get to your destination, which is where it's most important, the HIV farm.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get in the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of treatment of HIV with the current drugs that is a treatment of life in the face of <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Well, let's make the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care about wounds and surgical surgery -- they can be used for anything else -- including shipping drug transportation.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes that open up and close almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
And we sent a small laser ray on the cellular membrane cell while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser runs through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> of <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser -- we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it runs to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research researcher in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving a lot of conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> even we should be able to <unk> or <unk> in any kind of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons why they do it, how do they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks on Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
They're multitasking times.
We had a complex <unk> complex machine, radio stations and online websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but through business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> increase their funds, to better recruit and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else -- create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they train professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state didn't make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn in war or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> can also be understood as well as the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high price price for the population.
But in general, provide social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, election election is in 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without the social job of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, they participate in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And as much more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, fewer organizations, we can get them as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory running all its <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak are the states, like in the Middle East -- and they fill that gap the actors were not government actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools not military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better than groups -- we will better understand what incentives will offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safe emptiness to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive at a start.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label would be unfair to the <unk>
I am <unk> but quite bad.
And so I would get married as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what it started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and the sex -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a nasty and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's like or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I became growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would take the same paycheck through the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have right to use very easy and accessible to contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to embrace our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body -- expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I'm listening to rap music <unk> all volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and <unk> to me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang <unk> <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical name.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
And the <unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales that they do.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise your kids, they accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> conventional feminism that has bypassed or <unk> historically, the needs of the women of color, gay workers, and <unk> in favor of white women, <unk> from middle and high.
Listen, if that is good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist guy.
It also happens to be this: How do I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we would make perfection.
When we were <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I've already considered me from that <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a <unk> fear of what that tag means, for fear of not being able to be able to fulfill the slightly realistic expectations.
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist
In the <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a show by showing you to this pop star over openly the feminism and make the women and the young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began endless if it was <unk> it was or not a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and adult woman.
It takes tremendous perfection because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We're going to be a lot beyond sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism percent of any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from to recognize our <unk> to give up to the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions are playful this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two little girls and <unk> and very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
They are going to be reminded of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, suddenly, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program tries to be sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies are not dealing with women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to even more like us and even more like us to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we are not <unk> but no longer these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the people in the power of directors and market producers and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with courage to our good, bad, or from any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as though it's nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't believe was to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was amazed in a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
The words of the women who showed me was not anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing, and I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the thing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the stupidest reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a little bit of <unk>
Just after Christmas of the last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> for being visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be a terrible for a child with a immune immune system is one of the diseases that can be <unk>
There's a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be solved by autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked controversial about autism and vaccines are <unk> and <unk> by being a fraud fraud by the British Medical School.
They don't think most of the smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her thinking about developing his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates estimates about only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising organizations like <unk> <unk> referred to the autism as an epidemic, as if I could give it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Center for Disease Control which is going on, what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnosis, and "an detection of <unk> to explain these figures <unk>
But that kind of language does not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of her two years, the visual contact of a child.
If the criteria of diagnostic had to <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the kind of <unk>
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> to people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving the hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic as when you don't put his favorite toy in your usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the <unk> patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s as the main authority of the world in the subject, I declared that I had seen less than 150,000 cases of his syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis of children with seizures -- but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned to nine of each 10 children sent for other doctors to his office by being autistic -- without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood disease, caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they were kept carefully in a refrigerator and not <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster out in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before I turned two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite record, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the kids were simply telling them what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> in London, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers -- I was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard to raise a girl as no longer services, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To argue with the National Service, they had more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years ago.
They launched a prevalence of prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, or dinosaurs or <unk> <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit into beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of your data.
How did nobody ever realized these children before?
But then I found a reference to an article that was published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he stood up buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers a alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and children followed their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability, of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he started calling them in the development of education methods that were especially appropriate for them.
The Asperger's of Asperger's saw autism as a diverse diverse array of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and always been, looking at the aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture like the <unk> social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s, and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one and <unk>
These changes don't fell into broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between me to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I was coming out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts who knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, the teachers and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact, they hoped that it was, by making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming the vaccines for the increase in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If we have the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand the <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the standard standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit <unk>
Indeed, people autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most intriguing aspects of autism are in understanding the teachers, employers with support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover for <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go through an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste any brain.
Thank you.
