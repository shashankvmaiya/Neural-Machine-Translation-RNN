You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I am probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can tell you as a farmer, or with <unk> and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that came to you somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went on to bleed every week in the kids' bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He made it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to go through this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and you get rid of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because
It's something we knew how to do.
And as a woman who wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her from it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs to -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I went down to my surrounding water -- almost 60 feet away, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up and hold on to the end, while others can't get them more and <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, by looking at a <unk> which are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
And as a <unk> I'm breathing out of your atmosphere <unk>
And as an iceberg melts in sweet water in minerals that feed a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get to witness a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg in the average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding it, I don't pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome is joined by the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and the life starts.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground that I would have two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people are going to hear the anatomy -- they say, human bodies, and they say, how have the body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is by an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with identical twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical towers doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional female <unk>
We can see <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't happen in human forms or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that you become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks a receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops up following a course typically <unk>
When he <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. He's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
And then you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think -- I think a Catholic woman doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old guy born and raised as a <unk> he had girlfriend and sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a guy and I had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had 20th percent, and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having a medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman on the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with clinical chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- they have tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how much that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- that are <unk> twins, twins, or <unk> <unk> or <unk> surgeries that are not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> to several surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wants to have an African anatomy in the historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people inside a body.
The highest case is last year in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What a test are going to do to determine whether it's a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you to explain to journalists that there's no such a test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- we thought that these categories were going to be held by stable categories that would be used directly to <unk> categories, and they are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens to be much more complicated than the terminology that the terminology is.
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we get in science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the categories that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone considers dead.
Our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved to still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with a prisoner's dilemma, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I gets nervous.
You know, these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It was from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent dream of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I meet each other watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
Parents are going to be <unk> for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> it was a <unk> concept, and it would do it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents, the <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be used by the right of the child's grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents would have rejected that idea and it was replaced by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game of game and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear -- if you look at the story of the Parents -- I think many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> and they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what did it happen next?
And women are <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men on the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color <unk> <unk> about <unk> difference and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Civil <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to have anatomy.
I don't mean that the <unk> children should be allowed to have sexual relationships or getting married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do you keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was it born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, the other hand, was born in term: was born the March March of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right of sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, by virtue of being considered man -- if I don't have told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
I read for your part, it doesn't have the same rights to the marriage of marriage in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in many aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went down so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we going?
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of attitude attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are caught up in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests with people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks like this.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to deal with this to make rights to people, because I've been saying that I know of some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions, intelligent decisions, about their sexual relationships than people I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe maybe with an MRI ...
We really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian person in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago, and then they pick them off and then they pick up their <unk>
But when the phone asked the operation was a very <unk> operation, he said to me that in that other country, these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of the separation of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are without <unk> to change the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to finish -- I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it is that I think you can have different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
feminism has to do with rid of rid of the stereotypes with gender stereotypes -- so there's nothing <unk> in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about his question, more than there is something <unk> in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, on average, a different thing between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if Parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people by the state of the state, it's possible that we have <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that is what we need to do in the future when we get democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city by willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than its building cost.
So we could easily use the world to <unk> perhaps hundreds, new cities.
Well, this might sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just went through buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and that half is still not based on it.
They could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem is that those buildings and the areas that all around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions in the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, building a fully new, new apartments and when the norms of that place <unk> the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to bring new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reshape Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75 thousand <unk> they would get out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next few elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which they <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and stare at all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like of rules to <unk> and usually are the standards that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala friend sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was quite abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to be able to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going to move on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that for <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covering more than 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince you to convince them that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that measured at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained about the <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North
And they also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government -- they would need help from <unk> countries, could benefit from the countries that help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust the <unk> which is effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be able to deal with a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted on Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to make these special developmental regions.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all over the society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, he passed over another voting voting -- from <unk> to one.
Immediately after voting on the eighth of 21 to 24, a delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, we've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators and to allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the last sentence for this new <unk>
There are <unk> urban builders that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are many companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's one million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to get a work, sometimes they have to win the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are a children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these, all over the world?
What do you seem to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, again, and more recently, photograph and publishing on my blog <unk> colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'm from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we were doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone to have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what suit.
I've brought seven pairs of interior, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after getting here to <unk>
And since I don't know as a woman who walks at TED in inner clothes,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger tiger it.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
Almost you can almost always see a phenomenal <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in a week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember to her little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you good with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside, you don't see that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth about six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal <unk> and only one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people approached me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we need to leave certain things.
I don't need to have emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart, and I find it out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be a totally intuitive.
So where does your brain look at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be just in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and I didn't really do it very well, and it was always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking website, he taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things will not allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model of conceptual world, except that you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they make all sorts of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not really often that we often have particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit right to my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all of us following the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't been.
And so I would feel much better if I could actually prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we do a very good focus on little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of metal, which is a way of springboard and that <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip again, and I put all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming form that sits under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum factor, but for it it needs some help.
Let me just make an analogy.
You know how it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people get up to do those things, because I don't want to do it to you, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of the journey of inanimate objects are not just the light that <unk> and the wind that goes back and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that was what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then we put up a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then you put it into a temperature of less than a degree to the absolute absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their motions.
We discovered that was moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expanding and <unk>
And by giving you a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that metal piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
You want to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece of metal may be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logic part that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we get it, and we turned the lights back and look inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about quantum mechanics that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months old.
A lot of negotiations and stories, the <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
better than it shows the demo to then then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been done from their launch.
So we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the square gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite favorite, the <unk> museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the <unk> and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the room.
They go forward. That was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started playing, and I found myself with something that happened there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I came up and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is at a <unk> with a pole on a pole on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further on and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll really see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come up a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really makes it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things more here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can actually create your own museum, create your own collection of all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just done a zooming in it.
It's about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice for his work and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that asked me today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, Italian, <unk> all of the children in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened very interesting in the racing race in the last two decades.
A long time, if you wanted to win a career for Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- you won the race.
This is what in engineering, are <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
So what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered by networks and electronics.
They're going back to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can note -- if we wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but represent the 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all existing atoms come back and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- actually you can still see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and so what didn't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup spectrum.
Maybe some of the remember remember, they played <unk> and France, and at the end of <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, in the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by watching activity on the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is on the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people over here, and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call fast and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they went to the center of the winning team and the first minister of time.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time you get older, people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and consume.
Today, we know all about our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in their shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all possible to be.
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less power.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think we believe is that if you see every day that the cup that we <unk> not yet is somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we dropped a day still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things really cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is run over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was: how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop, it was, imagine you have a <unk> and you have valves from <unk> <unk> tubes.
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels end the pixels you can write in them, to show you patterns, images, texts.
And when the curtain goes into the curtain will open up so that we can happen in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it.
And we started a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows -- but when you come up with it for you to be able to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
So those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof goes down, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
Here's how it goes.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that was going to open for you to happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes of water and one had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because the architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use that people will give us our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have a little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, that moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal setup in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get rid of it, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an entry that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the world's best dancers in today's background, the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use it as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so many 3D <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world in the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can actually move from the digital world -- we can go through the digital world, the physical world of the <unk>
In our case, this may be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or CO2 emissions, how do you happen from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, by a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with the pixel ...
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you would tell you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better shape, to be stronger and more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure one.
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they were those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are they going to tell you about.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to make creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> should probably be the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many of the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them -- that makes me feel like a medical doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a lot of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense to the light of the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, that's chemically <unk> of which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the more <unk> bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> comes up with the <unk> you think of the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm cold <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without any effort of their part.
It's really as a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of any rush <unk> towards the output.
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients. <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like a single and the human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you had a <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I was aware of something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two two cells.
But when organisms come up with <unk> organisms start to change.
It goes into the scene <unk>
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body is going into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a gorgeous <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, I said, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of spending the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to give you not a <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily respond to longevity.
They don't necessarily respond to the greatest or the stronger or the faster and even the most smart.
Evolution tends to be better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that they can survive if there were fish there, <unk> fish in a vacuum, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this happen, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if you look ahead and go forward, the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I didn't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the thinking of thinking is that through medicine, in the first place, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have ceded our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need for evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the natural kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll back slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species -- distant planets are going to exist, and environmental changes that can produce the evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility -- an intriguing possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it the <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we be doing this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up at the individual and family level.
So think that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and he was 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost close to <unk> 20,000 and a week.
Not much to make the human genome actually actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more and more in the end of all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu flu vaccine, in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two other <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes in order to prevent diseases are going to allow us to also allow us to adopt the <unk> -- a better memory.
Why not have the <unk> of <unk> Ken especially if you could go to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of spending this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to turn the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a thousand years ago, and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to be in front of them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For bad, or for evil, and before what I could do is that these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So he immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three times happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
Take the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words -- the most <unk> words.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to embrace all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
And the second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a <unk> at that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason for <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> by 14, 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I was going, I had the feeling of, Wow, not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to say, "I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And scream, <unk> as a little bit.
And for me, that was all reason to be in the world.
And at that point I understood that those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, to not die that day.
And he gave me another gift that was the chance to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying up today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is the thing that <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came up to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has a complete loss.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation -- so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're a major person and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone to see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they will make it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was obsessed with his brother and his father in that precise moment, "All right, well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about it, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much on your inner can't <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the heart attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in <unk>
And so the journey started.
And two years later, about a year later, after a year later, and a lot of <unk> and a lot of moving things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine to <unk> it would be a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from the whole corner of the <unk> in our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have removed the frames of the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the voyage of <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of glasses of cheap sun that we bought on the ship of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and now there's a <unk> we published the software <unk> the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning two weeks of programming, Tony returned back at night, Tony came back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
And the funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we were looking at it as if we were doing graffiti as well.
So at the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and it took me out there so that I could do it.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized that one of the 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the world's best <unk> in the urban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be at the show that it's pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it happen.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something, and I was fascinated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to do every day when we can find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in terms of very difficult situations and at the same time such a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating just this funny thing in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been involved in horrible situations with the only purpose of <unk> with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that make interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that looked like fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I could come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered on the name of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What there was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into <unk> you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I could not have done it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, looked at the world of marketing and advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> I could <unk> for something so hard or as dangerous as I go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to try to do a film that tries to be about <unk> products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom of the end of the end, it has pictures of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure that we're going to take all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you have <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink than you had <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- all the shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to help me help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to it.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money takes to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to be meeting with them, but it certainly is worth convincing a couple of big events.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the movie is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or being I?
JK: So both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I got to myself, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
It's actually not, there was no such thing.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents is.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that appeared.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey -- No.
This was the problem: <unk> from simulation or <unk> easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line -- maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it something it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still continues to <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also too risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's really risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and that's he staring at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go for my own, I would have to take off the middle and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see from a sudden -- and I started to give up <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant movies, and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies, they say that the reason their films have so much success to the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm coming out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the general.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
You know, the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to do in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you fresh and more <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it was <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like this.
Usually I carry on as <unk> and I like the <unk> and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The mark I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of guy.
They had toys for pets on the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often believe myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These guys shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which they <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things came out and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next is this is the best day of my life."
A: So how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: That's how I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that serve us?
What is the <unk> What a <unk> phase is now?
Why is it important? <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scared -- what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Good <unk> A: Yeah. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but it was <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think some companies will only be <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give you something positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity identity, your personality identity, what would that be?
You are a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be a cool thing, like the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more of attribute <unk>
Are you conscious as a <unk>
Are you very traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you very stable, stable, <unk> reliable and, safe, sacred <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI <unk> to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as to film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
All over the city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting way into the public problems with political problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the most successful answer or that I've had more successful are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They got success?
Well, since the movie came from the <unk> Festival will take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or TV or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
There's not even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk about, they will give their customers not to be a part.
I've always believed that if you get to risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing up to failure.
I believe that when you train your employees at loss <unk> the risk of risk is preparing the whole company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move on, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to house transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk -- <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> who were <unk> <unk> rights <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So June Cohen: So, <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check in the name of the TED Lab, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are in real control systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus out of Windows a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, area, then we're smart.
This is the <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> entered the gray, gray, <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we found this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat it.
I had no sense for me.
And then from experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that you're trying to infect is actually working on that place: up.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant plant -- or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out the code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They are all points to attack them.
You probably even know how much they did the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at initially were called the systems of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to get them with the real world, with potential of the real world.
We need theories about how they can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant plant and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> it certainly can be <unk> and even making the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what about the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so that there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been brought from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> pointed to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not care that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
That's the gray box, and the top of the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the entry values of sensors for example of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and the vibration <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes out of speed, you have to open escape tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do this human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see specifically, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a power plant, or in an <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you do, with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with lots of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start to work now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been made public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give <unk> abilities or other that makes the wall of lawn chairs and come back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is in addition to your speed, and aid, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connected it with the universe and with other <unk> <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on a <unk> load of pounds, and it's getting <unk> to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications in their back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human bacteria.
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take them 90 kilos for data for a number of hours.
Its flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it goes up my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of <unk> chairs about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people -- roughly, in chairs.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with often very young people in the spinal cord that when they started their life -- 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is getting paid quickly.
His only best, many times -- a brain injury or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column and as a result was able to go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It was completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer computer, here on the back.
There is some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing in the bottom <unk> <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all a feeling and all movement from <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never come to <unk>
That happened was 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future future generations -- not only of soldiers, but how Amanda, and all the users of chairs of wheels, to all.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say, hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of <unk> <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of rainforests in the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives closest parents.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known to their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where domestic violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been given for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger of the <unk>
<unk> meat trade and deforestation are making it not to fill or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes, <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play over all of their life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to create links and foster <unk>
And with him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo looks at the same <unk> roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual, <unk>
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild species.
First, it's a <unk> style game, and I'm not a football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because I think, this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual things to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time is more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and out of it.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we need to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
In order to adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But do we get to the most our ability to play.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans -- life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate thing to play, you can be the moments where it is the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting the poverty, <unk> <unk> as a captain of the captain in a body of fire used.
And in our city, where the volunteers represent a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a race to go against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our work was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came to the captain and he asked her to go and would save the dog owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a building on the flames to save a live being alive only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got on the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> <unk> that at that height more or less had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for home owns where, as I was waiting to wait, her trove of attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the <unk> owner of the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer girl, I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace on the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done it, or they're doing -- it's going to be -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: No wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, I am now.
They took food in a dining room, a park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you trained to go to <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big helicopter of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules from a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, a <unk> came up with this.
It was called the <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> universe, stacked up with a few other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of concrete, the transistor allows to create a much bigger and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I don't personally do that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I began to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each one with specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through similarities.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the same, the blue is the stream, <unk> is the input and the orange of orange is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue person with one green is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a nest module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures in it.
To make <unk> faster or slow down, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection of it.
We want all of interactions in the world to be used to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a night of night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronic experience begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago --  A few weeks ago, we took the School of the School School of Rhode Island that they don't have any experience in engineering, just in wood and wood and paper and said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in reach of all.
So, <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I am given the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work on government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of preparing the Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They did great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the chances of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look at a quote, but what really looks for is that someone else is going to clean up, because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time <unk> last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
By doing so, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the youngest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government will do.
And it extends viral.
A responsible for <unk> city systems to see this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> of tsunami, but people get <unk>
That's why he asked the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that would be using using it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> organic and nature.
If you know a bit of government technology, you will know this doesn't happen.
<unk> software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by normal channels, would have taken at least two years and end two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the power of California that the time has gone over 2,000 billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that has a couple of days and it spreads into viral form, is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best government ways to work, not as private companies as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can make it together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that, but they don't have a lot of <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they didn't get <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking will affect the way of producing change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of mobile care center, and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open the doors of the house, put music very strong and see if it <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web and a mobile, called <unk> <unk>
They don't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually came up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report would say, "I approached the place, I found the cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening. <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to the distributed volunteer collaboration as well.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for the people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
<unk> two people.
And I could have connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people -- but you think that one is the entry of the other.
What our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will bring our values and we understand our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that it belongs to us that we financed as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and the result is losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work out and make the bureaucracy be sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
Have you <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That is not political activism -- it's <unk>
And so we have taught ourselves to the government, it's time to ask ourselves, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go where we have to go without fixing the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without <unk> we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can spread back to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost by granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't care a lot about your voices.
They're using your hands.
They lay the work for the work to make applications that make better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out a garbage bucket that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're the citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they didn't take the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we're also going to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, the jails and death row.
I've spent the most of my life in the communities that are living in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here are impact on the world.
On occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little to look at him, and I looked at it, and I was a good hug.
It was so strong that I could barely breathe and then I get <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I would get back and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to get his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up in the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and he looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went out of my hand and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you about it."
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just want you to take me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that I'm always going to be doing the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do, is that I would never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother a older year and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, my brother came home with a <unk> package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I landed on my gaze with strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this spread out <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can say I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I'm saying it for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they don't really see sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One in three black holes between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In the urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in prison or parole.
Our system is not just distorted versus race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these aren't all of us.
We are <unk>
It seems to me interesting.
We're looking at our work with some of the other developments quite curious.
In my state in Alabama, in Alabama, as in the other states, you give you any rights <unk> if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has basically lost the right to vote.
And if we projected the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this stunning silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it was known for 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without chance of getting out ever.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They have people in death row.
This business penalty issue is interesting.
In a certain sense of sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by mistake.
From every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and released from death row.
A <unk> error, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you wouldn't ever be able to fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history -- I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who get me close to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, it makes people stop saying that in our own history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we have historically done.
All of the time <unk> one with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and he said, "You know that it's OK to listen to what they would be.
<unk> we don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never get it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we put to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
lately lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in some ways, something that's inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe that we haven't seen it.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the <unk>
With innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation to the spirit, an will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality to injustice.
Now I want to imagine that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from knowing Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We are going to get them to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I would say, "I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I would give him <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And I was there, I was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> me give me this idea of <unk> justice idea.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination on the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> put me the finger in the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst thing that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that belongs to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves for our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not by the way they treat rich rich, powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
And the judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One evening, I was awake <unk> my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think of it, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old client -- a little, black <unk> black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black client is treated as a privileged <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical or a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or actually <unk>
For my horror, there was not only the <unk> but he had sent to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got on the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car, walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> he was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I came up with me and <unk>
And I'm going to tell me in the ear, to me.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When you walked in, the judge looked at me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> and we started <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The policemen got the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and I was talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and try to hear all that <unk>
They were walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black, <unk> <unk> walked in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break a <unk> came up with <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to the justice.
That we can't really be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> from <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Talk to you to hear and see a very clear <unk> desire for this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be a <unk> effort in which you spend today in punishment policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law to get the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who believe it is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it emerges this dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince us for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats by death bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months <unk> could be over the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that the press media would prefer to sound negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses are getting much more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing care about survival, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So for that one <unk> of stories, looking at the negative.
That old adage that "If there's blood and <unk> it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a week, no wonder that we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues, the climate change, of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings as human beings are very good at taking care of the problems and in the long run, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would get it.
And we continue to get higher expectations more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, television, mobile phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is the technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend of Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I would put in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance of the price of 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone is in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
This is Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession in <unk> in <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
So computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call the molecular computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, the 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the digital medicine and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
Play with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in the mobile.
Four hundred years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It is about taking that little bit <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington ridge to Washington is from aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like the <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as a <unk>
So let's get this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet -- by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about scarcity, but it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, the solar will cost six cents a hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager Voyager towards the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of it is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you with you, he gave me permission to take your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a refrigerator smaller.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any fresh water source, <unk> water -- by less than two cents a gallon.
President of Coca-Cola has just thought that I will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation, this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
And we had that <unk> warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart smartphone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton was 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one might have predicted ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music, technology technology -- <unk> -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing will come up with the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, and something called the X X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device that they talk, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA of RNA or DNA that would not be <unk> to call the health care and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk> billion.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to empower the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds had never been before <unk> to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What a <unk> What <unk> <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- because of the use of impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three million more members of the healthy humanity, healthy educated <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the controls, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power to act for the first time?
What did these three <unk>
And if you are contributions we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams -- guided by his passion with one of course, can do things that they could only do things that they could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this college professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better folding than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three new minds of new minds that are going to be given to work on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I would give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, like you know, in <unk>
They probably believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And they described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a West in Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 degrees, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and I was going for a good moment, so I was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had fallen down in half.
Let's go to the five inches at five.
We have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> it started in the <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this little bit of <unk> was called <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we took studies in the southern Sea Sea Sea <unk> and, especially in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And the vast majority of fish are <unk> tiny things about <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then it starts the commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
I once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember.
So let's start the starting point to start the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you did this happens something like this.
And on the axis -- we have a lot of <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images to be at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end, I keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in a big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit of common.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in an synonymous sea of great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect it to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them are going to be like Captain such as Captain such as a captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually they use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the huge role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we actually map the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine protected area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema might fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay
A long time there had been gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why do we take the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
And so my only <unk> the only thing to give, is it tends to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are making viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But now the website now makes any of us, or from our actions, copper that in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done in the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only a small percentage is viral is getting infinite <unk> and <unk> <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside of his house in the National Park National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of the popularity last summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a two. <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this email that I was sending to the video to <unk>
<unk> <unk> as Jimmy <unk> are presented to us new and interesting things, and we would get them to a wider audience.
Ha sounds) You have to start on a Friday.  So you all want to come up with the end of a week --                        I won't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day on particular <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of makers will embrace a point of view, and share it with a broader public accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big inner joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that is weird, you know that there's a <unk> version of three hours of time.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up in the community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it was made.
And all of a sudden, it came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a <unk> something that we can all form a part of it.
Because today it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk>
What script could have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, only the only one and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who <unk> against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was blown away by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that hold you properly <unk> by <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and its humor, Casey <unk> made that five million people saw and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all new that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators are, creative communities of participation, that totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media, which we all have access and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin began on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- it's barely the current media, but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one unit of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long time friends, I'm going to get it.
They were <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat got married to the sea dressed up to the sea as a boat <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the <unk> the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother carried a <unk> with poison.
If we get older, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the whole horizon and a vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to pick up six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, he finished the journey was too much to it, and the first apple that I did, because of the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in the long three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle suburbs of the middle class whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English are <unk> among the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days, <unk> turn.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they developed an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, it doesn't mind what you should have <unk> which was usually <unk> he was always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
I had a school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
It was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares were working for <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> guys caught between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classical <unk> student with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in life -- tragically tragically, <unk> by drug abuse and insulation.
But a lot of they got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of photographer, I was elected the young Australian Australian year.
And I was a piece of one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
So <unk> resident anonymously from <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses that she'd never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire the details and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when she got into the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> he said, "Well, you're not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about, the more I was talking about to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a security race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger again on the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that I'm going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a power there, a <unk> optimism. a mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
So let's get to a small group of people who <unk> <unk> cannot be a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They go to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had been <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before you end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matter.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and he took the cause her, and it was much more <unk> caused when I won.
The one cannot be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, a thousand miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
She asked the <unk> "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us together, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives and would have been <unk>
<unk> would have been easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> <unk> in every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them and see it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of the <unk> is today in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the African <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We do this with airplanes.
At that time, when we <unk> the great prince warrior Indian warrior -- he was <unk> he pulled out a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we found was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a little girl, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver <unk>
And this piece of technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door towards a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I got back, I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was <unk> books since I was 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device that could connect the readers to the whole world.
You can know how we take the book, you know.
Where we are.
We put the text with the image, animation, the sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...   He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a few moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to the magic of our childhood, and those ideas that were <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me up.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
There are certain points of the book as well.
I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that tries to current issues like the environmental crisis.
And, talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a little girl, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this early ritual of childhood, you have to go out and in a chapter, you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This is a way of a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connection between magic and the Earth and the technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on it, and the video goes on, and it actually sees a cartoon of cartoons that appear on inner inner plants.
At a moment, the screen is full of <unk>
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you try to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be attached to technology and magic and technology come up with one another.
We have the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic and the children that sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and it gets off.
Every morning <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends up my information to Google <unk>
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time where it needs <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As a few of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you climb up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure on the base pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from the week I will be available by the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people who were able to go from their houses, take their blood pressure, they get to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, come back to recover the control and to ship <unk> of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention and the demand for demand and other issues.
So the techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video video.
We all have some shipping leap on the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know exactly where <unk> <unk> are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because they are sometimes opening up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they had been presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else would be able to use your iPhone, and then the next few weeks will use your cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to go to the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work and act and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, can find it.
And I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You might be <unk> or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that it shows is still in place.
So please, <unk> in this and not just improve health, but taking control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion of drawing but it was a little bit different because of the camera using the camera was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a very <unk> <unk>
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a <unk> level.
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the leadership level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that we have to catch a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look like real?
It's the details or the <unk>
Do you get the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three different objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to look realistic I think they're those in which we don't even get the things around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine the photographs that is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to be able to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pump of stone.
And yes, even I made the house from the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to get a realistic result of a realistic result of planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that results can be very beautiful and at very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
If you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the big way.
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this is that this one, like many other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why does technology look at technological scales.
The answer is that if you draw the answer to a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some of the time -- and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you would say, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, this is a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology is going as fast as the <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years will advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- if you get to -- look -- look at these <unk> curves that are not still forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or it will become a typical <unk> I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe that will happen something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
How new state the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, we are engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think this is because something is going on.
So a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't really have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
And so I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a half billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that these chemicals are organized -- we give a sense of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that time, there was about oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes on it.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them into the outside of the outside and that drops grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe of chemists.
And every time you were <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that in some way it will be <unk> being better at the time of adding the chemical chemicals -- they get more chemists and they get more <unk>
Often they lived over time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemical life, but things get interesting in interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to be <unk>
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this Darwinian evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe for our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did only for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the security people in the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things are going to be very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information into the community of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can trade DNA.
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were put together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether if a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community became more <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in the community.
They are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that we process the mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because he knew how bad and sick the last time she ate out.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of it.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in my head.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated to become sound, in the sound sequences -- and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in history.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years every one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The following, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And next to the electronics, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that deserves its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at this explosion.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the Internet advances in the headlines.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting approach I've been using is the evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of every day.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred <unk> sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and they will take those that are going to be <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to talk numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to place numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that would better do the <unk>
They get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we get the best to get the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who would be <unk> and that the children are going to get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of standard programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
There are some mutations there.
And it tries to try and get it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to talk about them to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strangers.
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and that's why I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog time to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of what is going to be here.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give you a part of my false <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talk about statistics and use to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300, from a <unk> which is <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and that anyone who's trying to get to the first base -- not to come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, actually, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, this is someone who from 10 cents hit me four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Mayor of <unk> in running more 400 strikes in a regular season.
Now let's get this to my medicine world where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a number of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a distant place and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family doctor derived a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 dollars.
But you know what?
She's getting a lot of a living year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you think that should be the average of a heart surgeon, or a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
Very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is send them to the world, and I would be included, with the mandate of being perfect.
I'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
Probably which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> differential diagnosis and the standard.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then you would know everything else -- close to everything, because so I would tell you about mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady <unk> the emergency service where I worked.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist I was going to get to that patient.
And reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a sound <unk> on both sides, which gave me a heart failure of heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, and they fill in blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> of water, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes in fact.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I probably didn't want to be a resident that will pay attention to it.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it to your house, not paying attention to a voice on my inner phone that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unhappy that until I asked the nurse that I would join the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm okay.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that the <unk> and the ambulance together with the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad job in the stomach,
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I got to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. And at that time, I did something I don't do normally, I did.
It went through the emergency service of the way home.
And there another nurse, not the next lady <unk> earlier, but another one told me three words, those three words that most medical emergency doctors.
Other specialists who fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I would give her high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the <unk> the <unk> with a blood pressure from 50 millimeters to <unk> which means a shock of severe <unk>
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff will spread all their resources.
They gave up medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the cores.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was hoping against the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days, it was obvious that they never get back.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And by ninth day, they let him go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I went through that and experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I sat by himself, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more making that mistake.
It's that shame that gives a teaching.
The shame I'm talking about is the one that makes us feel very wrong about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we made was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family, and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept doing those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why would I send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
<unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you put the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would get those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant at the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my shift for guard, my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made three words: <unk> <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially lethal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it goes top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until again, and again, and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
You know, an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out a colleague of mine who was looking at the patient -- some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it and see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon a surgeon.
Both of them were operated by operated and recovered well.
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
<unk> have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get my eyes and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show this to do not make the same <unk>
If I would walk into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital would <unk> the wrong leg, believe it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that do not sleep and the ones that I know; they can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> and the ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you care about medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical health and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto Wars to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes are happening every day, in which one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where bacterial infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian medical errors <unk>
The United States Institute established a 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is spreading every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect record of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in the chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals rather likely to say, well, you don't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, white art, I would say to everyone, this is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the <unk> to the head of laparoscopic surgery, this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students are <unk> <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They could say, "Look, you don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they could do it.
They need a healthy medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor at a time.
The classic doctor is human. The human <unk> you know, they accept it, and they won't be proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They would bring the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for support that they are all <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time at time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human, I will be aware of errors.
And I feel a lot of it, but I will try to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average number of choices that I choose to pick an average American, are about 70 to a day.
It doesn't make a lot of research followed by a week to a group of companies.
Researchers had recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required for an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you play the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this -- I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I am blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for giving you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this supermarket.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different classes of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we had water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asking for one occasion, why I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf of <unk> oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
Once I decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me with a full <unk> buses that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a post to <unk> right to the store.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case is people willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, which when there was only six, one percent.
We also look at what case were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
When I had been stopped when there were only three to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were <unk>
Well, you decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably get less good -- less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices are affecting us in a good <unk>
We decided to decide, even though this doesn't happen to us.
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, of a million Americans, of a few of the plans in this country.
So we were interested in seeing if the number of funding is available in savings plans for retirement savings program -- <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had plans that were from two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, as much as the number of choice, more people are being used to avoid actions or hedge funds.
In terms of more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these really extreme decisions are the ones that we are talking about, to optimize the welfare well-being future.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative consequences for us to get more and more possibilities.
What is more likely to do is that <unk> the decision, even though this is going against the <unk>
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in health.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even though they saw the better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choice of that stunning <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a shape or another, in different research, so they can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than now.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, will be an increase in sales -- <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent <unk>
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats who are less <unk> became the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
And you know that supermarket will be known to today, on average, they offer 45 products.
In a grocery store, they offer 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce online.
In the world of financial savings I think one of the best examples that has come out of how do choices do better as a David <unk> David <unk>
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safe background.
The people really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how <unk>
They are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday vacation with all paid to the most <unk> road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think that I actually hit more <unk>
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
So people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it be real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, we were looking at exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give the staff who would think of the positive things that they would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway we did.
What we saw is that I could see that I could see the <unk> in the middle of the <unk> the show of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This classification framework is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that <unk> not when they <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good <unk> a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go out of a lot of options, 56 colors -- a few times -- four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> the default button again and again and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options in many, you continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even if you pick the box of changes don't tell you anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways you make us a choice.
We are excited about a product that we are building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminating <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more we careful to be in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in the East East Germany, if you had a typewriter I had to go to the government.
I had to record a text sheet of text written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a written on the wrong message they could track the footprint up until the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would give up the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and you can print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow <unk> on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> so much.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online cases that would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online but they do it by illegal means by stealing <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information out of our cards when we bought a computer <unk>
The secret secret service of America was two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us will be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of suicide in the importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves around, the protests, the protests, motivate the opinions, we laughs them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the U.S. governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an endless authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and provide a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with government government representatives asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What does the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign killer authority that was foreign <unk>
And that was <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters based on the U.S. secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was some notes from a company based in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to protect governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If one is suspected of a criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems something bad, but it doesn't actually affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
Will it mean in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad in my dad, and behind the cows, the National Park National Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the highest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions do it, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we raised in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, we believe we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
They were dying that they protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the won of his father and this was the same thing that I was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were afraid of fear.
But I realized that actually this doesn't really happen, because even he helped male lions see the pen away.
I don't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions to believe that it was about the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they came up and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that is moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on to turn off and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load up the battery and the battery -- electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes lights <unk>
As you can see, <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> to male lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never came to have trouble with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by Kenya, for frightening to other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using them to clean elephant from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in meadows in the <unk> <unk> cows of my father, and used to see flying planes and told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come into airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electric <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electrical CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: So I read it at a time, right now -- right now, right -- I have tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take you on every step that I would give my friend from mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on Earth.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all of the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, South Korea, are enemies.
Although I was sometimes wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all of my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague of my sister.
And he said, "When you did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of time.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
He was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of their families.
A huge famine hit <unk> North Korea to <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few people eating grass, insects and cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the developing countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes I see bodies floating on the river, on the river, of the river, as well.
I can't reveal the details of how I got out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the famine years, I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it also dangerous, because the North American refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> by the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then I would get my skills in the Chinese language, and they made me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to finish up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> the officer told each other, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many may be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although it had been eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> in North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape -- many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard only to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be <unk> in a second.
This is why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided I will take it to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call my pride with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea was not easy, and I had a plan. I started to study for the exam <unk>
Just when he started to join my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese -- I had to do it in a way, for more than three thousand miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got caught up several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and spoke by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us all over and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at myself, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance of the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come up with the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM -- and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and the two North America and take them out of prison.
I went to him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the village would be when they were more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the <unk> that the people who are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But the freedom to get freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices and more and more.
We can also act like the bridge between North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is called <unk> stores of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city got together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles in South Angeles as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, in a food desert, Los Angeles Center to the home of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times higher than that, say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
So I was going to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I saw <unk> wheelchair and sold as a <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have any <unk>
What I did, was we plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a land of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet by <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to go.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided it would work.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, nine complete vegetables you know.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group paid by gardeners of all the <unk> all over the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city was on top of me and the <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A judicial order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had a story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's like 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on the hell does it look like this?
<unk> one plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, they cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. And my children there.
I was going to become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
Such as an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, soil like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They were going to see what the earth can do if they let it be your canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool of education, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how they affect guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, you get <unk>
I remember a time that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my backyard, and I went out and see very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by looking at people who were so close to me, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, "You don't temes don't temes that people will steal your <unk>
I say, "Of God I say, "Well, I don't fear that you're going to be <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what this is about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared my stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people that come and work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> the guys will eat <unk>
If they grow some <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you are not taught how food affects the mind and the body, eat blind what you would put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're sitting on, I see color types of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington George <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block from gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into the <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about <unk> because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people to work on the street, to know the guys on the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get them to take your <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me a little bit if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road here.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt than <unk>
And especially if you go on your bike, and these cars go around, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road in the road.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use right now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> and water can go through it, so all the water of rain flow over the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface goes out.
First stone -- then a stone, then many more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be converted into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you really see how the damage is in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so you only have a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and they separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting from steel to clean up, and we can cut out the wool of steel in very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel knitting in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks get caught back to the surface.
Today I used an oven, <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
<unk> <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the show coming out now.
And I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put the samples, we put a lot of burden in them, the following of them then with our <unk> machine and we went back to a try.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface of the surface. It really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curious about whether this works.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts like this.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radio.
He had a big smile in his face which was unusual at those days, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what to <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I'll never forget.
A real school indeed.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made the girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that nobody could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 percent of a little bit of a little bit of a little room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
As a while in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban would <unk>
We always wondered what they were.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was fortunate enough to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was a remarkable man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. In which his daughter, my mother went to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated raised became mastery.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to convert our house to school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
And for him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years, I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your house for a war.
But there is one thing that always will be with you, what you're here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So, you still want not to be <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the middle and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud of graduate school in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the <unk> who was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just fall away from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who drove him on the streets of Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the friend, <unk> for them, despite them, despite a <unk> opposition in it.
As a <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
It was less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get her home, you're the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would get it to try.
<unk> now, if he said, "but if he said, "but we don't harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and this is something that is often <unk> in the West, is that behind most of the people who have <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling kind of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> see a future <unk> and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> will be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I'd never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women, and women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the each regime, of freedom, <unk> dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to meet the brutal dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war, and a loss of about 50 thousand dead, we could release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved it, along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society by <unk> <unk> a <unk> transition and fair transition towards democracy and national dimension.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops on the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded <unk> women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> that was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, little to little, the joy of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> all the days of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The other day is <unk> with the news of the murder of the murder of the US and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the murder of the army killing of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their methodology of human rights rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society made up a revolutionary mindset, and they get older, and it's been removed from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to <unk> with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
So I am here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because the choices didn't brought peace, stability and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the choices that we only need the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the more than to need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as trade agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion agents and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting <unk> rather than <unk> <unk> in place of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, Libya, Libya, for war, desperately desperately needs to reach the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it was <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God's <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known to all of the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that matches all the humanity of men and women, where all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so as the uterus covers completely the <unk> which is growing inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- <unk> all existence.
This is how you tell us "My <unk> <unk> all things."
This is how you tell us "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They were going to give them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a spooky question, which has an equal response to the same.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody makes the reason why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I was just 22 at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I was going to love to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies of the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, every religions, every income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only about <unk> <unk> and long duration or said in the families, the last place where we would want to or we would expect to find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be used with a man who does him, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk> guy.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of mate.
He did it on the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- which was ready, that I was to Harvard, that I was a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done.
And it was why the degree of <unk> and the work in Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now the last thing I wanted to do was I'm going to go from New York City and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I had to get my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was coming from head in a physical trap and a financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to feel so safe was bought by three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma that he lived as a kid.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted up my hand, my life was already in danger, every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> was five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I had a girlfriend of my mother and married with him.
Despite what happened, I was sure that we were living happy to live forever, because I loved him, and he also loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and for the fact of forming a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never would make it harm.
I spent twice in our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I was going to get a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> moon was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> went on a or two times a week for the next two years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or online at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So I actually had a great company.
So back to my question: Why would I tell me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question around the world is why they just don't get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we were victims, because we are victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence occur after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other results include the permanent dignity, even after the <unk> had returned to marry, from financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to support the victim and their children, who are normally compelled for judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who would lead to his mother.
And we still keep wondering why it's just not going?
I was able to go on, because of one last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would be allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, all of all of the young strangers, and I'm here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say, <unk> is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims were intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also argue that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that they would promote their lives and joyful lives and happily like <unk> wives and mothers, fully free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical of domestic violence.
I became marrying a cute <unk> man, and we have these three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do is I will never have ever more, but it's a loaded <unk> pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says that he wants.
Right now, the same thing are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which silly <unk> but this whole time I've been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love to my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
It abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end up domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> of light talking about it with their children, their fellow friends and family.
You know, the vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> that have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe exit thing.
Together, we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  For lucky, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
And if some of the women are being asked, when they <unk> you don't have to get them to go on, but we find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to pass this sweater, for the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would go back the back and that <unk> the guy's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial ocean that I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our way -- which, shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a fashion model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, A <unk> was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last few centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed for <unk> also we've been associated with a high and <unk> shape of the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I have known to take money to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know how much models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told each and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that is, less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I really would tell you to every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this <unk> <unk> still <unk> No, it wasn't, like, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> magazine or the executive executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you turn your studies, and you have a pair of jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, you know, if you think that you want to be president of the United States -- but you have to get the Model of inner underwear for 10 years, people would look like this.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was going, and also the first time I was using a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I saw it next to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
These are a creations of a professional group of professionals, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and never use, except the privilege I get to get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to get money, and they gave me a free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> put a red light on red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me looks, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for how it doesn't matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and the past year of <unk> teenagers who stood up to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When I was looking at this talk, I found out that when 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it would be <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, smart people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little bit of more thin legs and the brightest hair, will be more happy?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair and clothes that are probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something that follows from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable with the recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't know the <unk>
There was no <unk> directors and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very low health care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture of holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He took the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When you approached the third birthday from my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to come to us, the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is as universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, nobody has <unk> with the camera.
And so we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day is that a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a particular journey.
They're also a way of stopping time on a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in every way.
Because even though we took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when suddenly, he was stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the string store that <unk> from little to previous <unk>
And it described to me what it was about five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that he remembered their heart <unk> to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of many family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes up the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to just come up in the picture, and I don't want to get it up to someone and asked, do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter -- <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament aren't clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the West Bank, where we have 16 species -- these 16, 11, they face a high risk of extinction.
So why are those <unk> important, they provide vital ecological services services -- <unk>
They are our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
They took the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that wouldn't be because of them would not be because of them and caused great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of license and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between United States and lower Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're doing very important <unk> to open sky. In places like Tibet, there are no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being applied is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years -- and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumer consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge amount of time for <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from the lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trading of <unk> dead in order to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they're going.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a consumer problem is not going to serve with anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you walk out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that changed from opinion because he saw it flying without effort, without suffering from the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do is I do and all I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa, <unk>
And I was <unk>
And we were going to go to the numbers, that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that I would do, I think so.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local <unk> tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not all at all interested in doing that, so I would give them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go to work, and we were aware that the local in so fertile -- valley, they had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking how it was possible that I was possible that we just said, "You thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, all in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato -- in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red one, at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to them, "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only of the Italians would bring mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they were doing, what the French did, and then they were doing what they were doing, and I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk>   <unk> see the waste that we were giving them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Western are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
I try to get any of a culture of different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I try all of a culture of different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white ones in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first beginning of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to age 27 years just to respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anyone, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Are you?
You would never have a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We became friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give you a sense of someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why don't they do, at a time, <unk> but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they would never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The more intelligent people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't get their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work in face, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family physician in the business -- which is established with you in your kitchen table, in the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform his passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk that we came to tell you what to do.
Within a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can we do it?" And I said, "I did a very, very difficult thing to do.
And I went out and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> again."
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
Design is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now they <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
You have to offer you privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then they will come up with the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to show you about this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneur entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the fossil revolution -- and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There aren't the technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a daily magazine makes many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk>   therefore, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared in the United States <unk> international manufacturers <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you a <unk>
Another way, they won't come to conversation with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated service service.
And then you will have to tell the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to be able to sell you has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
I've never met a single human being in the world that can make, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at the 100 icons of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one one, no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one begins a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of <unk> business in bars with bars along with their comrades dedicated to who will do by you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what do you get?
What can you? Can you do that?
OK, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects arose from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more hopes for the cows store so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant birds that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a <unk> in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful <unk> of the world, but also one with the most <unk> abandoned properties.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Her death was sudden and he was born.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this led me deep gratitude for the time and lived in the time.
He gave him clarity to the significant things in my current life.
But let's take this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to get to catch the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house in a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect about this experiment but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit down to <unk> on the <unk> line.
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to give you once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult moments.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and now they've made up in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions it's actually more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remember that life is brief and delicate life.
death is something that we're often trying to talk about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
It's going to be thinking about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about individuals and as community and with more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very <unk>
You don't speak, but it transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it <unk> what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at it: it's never <unk>
When I sing from our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even be able to do -- it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
They were <unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but you remember the year that I was every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the whole concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even though that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't agree with my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat whatever <unk>
As I grew up, it got more <unk> and the differences were getting more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> an innocent nature, a kid who looked at the world without <unk> a human being had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normality.
<unk> happens to high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them are wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could put it up a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and honestly, the search for normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a computer teacher, I would give a kind of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of these students with his great minds, his big books and his unknown <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it had had felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our greatest challenge, from energy to the environment and health care, and if we don't know we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as no scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go ahead with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the <unk> but studying the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a hurdle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that make them stupid <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said it is all as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate your science without engaging with ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways to hook them into their content.
And by presenting your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you asked why they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can provide graphics that will lead to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open open and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge with no matter -- platform or first, and when he wins, he gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of a guy with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They threw in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's true.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They had all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was going on for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want the Washington <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call King if he was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate that you came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. It was already before, but it only meant <unk> which was <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a <unk>
And that's why the Senate gets <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious degree with a <unk> and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I have been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is very lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk> --  -- possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air air fleet and so on.
The reality and the story has goes into the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the kind of 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, actually change a lot more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> on the land in a illegal mine in a illegal mine.
The air is charged with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that they talk about, but mostly this cacophony of <unk> male and stones and <unk> with primitive.
Like the other one, I took a cheap light of light -- it keeps the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter and fall hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before he lost the control and fell down to <unk> feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in the deep hole at their lives without paying any reward and, often, they die.
And I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never do it because they are <unk> of slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six countries and in 2009, and I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Between all the incredible people that I met there I met one <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that takes to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was there in the world but not to such a degree.
When we end up talking about I was very nasty <unk> I was thrilled to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> my stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the amount of African Africans throughout the whole of the slave slave every day.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> of <unk>
However, today you can enslave entire families to entire generations per capita <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from <unk> 13 billion per year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better job to find out that they are forced to work with no pay, under threat and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the <unk> goods of slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost all the world and yet it's illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like getting into the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of <unk> C, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> <unk> in a heavy canopy conditioning <unk> <unk> bricks in their head, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no special enough to eat, nor to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee was quite <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot and it stopped and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> I don't get it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizen from that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were.
I had to trust the <unk> and I had to work within the system for his release and trusted that <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles out of <unk> to trucks that they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids that charge and children would take them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously sex.
He led me by a little bit of the stairs who gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for prostitution by prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where they were bringing them together with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse for their customers.
On the <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> fear and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be <unk> in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no doors anymore.
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult issue, it is important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the <unk>
This is a family.
The black hands of black are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake -- the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older <unk> some older kids, and it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> and they often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, you get to the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
And because of fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> about the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were doing the last networks, but they had been working on a <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And I might point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which I was taking the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to take it through a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come up very quickly.
And then he pointed out the path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> and after walking close to an hour and we found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as it was <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and everyone was full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their back and they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
So those wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then they'll be transported to another area where the stone was going to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer close to the margin we see other fewer lucky ones, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
He died his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked on the mines 14 and a leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he dream with being liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of the background that inspires a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to be testimony to them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes it very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not about people, and real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think about these many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that the force will turn into a fire and that fire makes light on the slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live on the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this mathematical math and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the managerial histories.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk>   that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, destroy it gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time was a virtuous dancer dance.
Over the last few years has been done a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there's actually a cure will be when we have an objective measure when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's disease and other disorders of the movement there are no <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a <unk> neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, they never do. Never have been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could be done by their <unk>
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is I think about it as a conventional form of a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds at the way, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed the <unk> for example.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think of time that he takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal strings. As Parkinson's disease is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the bottom line you can see an example of the <unk> <unk> example of string strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're very low cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets so <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
You don't need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could make a massive amount of cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I would give the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's disease, you can call it under price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: They have a accuracy <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, well, what we did -- the project. We now have 99 percent of accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March in March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We lie in the darkness, in the dark rooms and therefore we avoid the solar light.
We do to the pink models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the impossible and we are going to tell us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of expertise with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little after that, an organization where I was the <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I went to <unk>
It's a small fishermen of fishermen located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level has reached over 24 feet tall and more than three miles on the inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. And we took the mud and let the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and cards and cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of people around us to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As he escaped the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean the toilets, the big, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of that day and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until we moved through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night came into Facebook contacted a few of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time, they came up with a little bit more pictures and it took more <unk> so this is that I walked into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people on <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporary <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we were in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour. It could be a few weeks.
It could make months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures were destroyed in saltwater, and it covered out of bacteria, with algae, even with the oil in the time with the time -- I continue to <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless I was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As a time once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> it itself but stopped when they realized that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not be <unk> we were able to put the images into a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble pretty far from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the staff to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that they had all survived.
The day I gave him his photographs his younger son <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could get to look at, something that he could remember from the past that I could remember from the past day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up more of <unk> <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- most of them came back in the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from all around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of full photos and <unk>
So for this time, we actually don't spend more of <unk> in teams and materials -- most of the ink in ink to <unk>
We took pictures of them.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one person loved somebody else.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would bring to you, but the first thing that we would have to look for.
This was the project, of the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone into the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, to bring something larger, using your talent to something that are not thin physical skin.
To finish I'd like to read this email -- he sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As I was born, I couldn't help but think about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> -- because a similar picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother and my daughter, and my youngest daughter, and my <unk> <unk>
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us inspired and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in the slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X, <unk> and we really challenge the camera.
If I take a laser laser, and I switch back and put it into a <unk> <unk> and it is in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a bullet bullet than a bullet bullet than a bullet <unk>
If you take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all this --  -- remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
A lot of photons eventually come to the lid and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, waves travel down the table and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, you see it in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if you take a common bullet and current and we make it go through the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit at the movie?
One day? Actually a week? Actually one year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow <unk>
And what about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that went from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more of this tomato -- you realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> still are still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a <unk> picture, it gets very light up.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest show, so I barely get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very small <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in raw and <unk> in a very interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would let him see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, and you can go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, it was slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point it corresponds to which distance.
When you project a laser you can record a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is around the curve, the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that could be able to see the inside of the body -- through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood and the blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualization to fix the problems of thinking about the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became a science of art, an art of photographs in <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
So creating a new form of computational photography with a slow camera and color code and color.
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
<unk> should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects.  Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes comes to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can break your life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can send a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you get them to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cellphone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people who were looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of all today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
databases.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single phone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where do we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or his <unk>
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people that came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany East
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, please give me all the information they had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I went back to them, and I got a concrete answer -- it was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end of the end, I <unk>
They would take the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first I saw them and said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to be <unk>
I want to make it public <unk>
Because I want to show people what the <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Project City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go back and go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call between them.
And then you call each other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they go to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who would send an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and they want to get them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to <unk> your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and it's not done anymore.
When you go home, you bring up to your representative that only because businesses and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, Sacramento, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, Sacramento, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus from my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, while they are.
Just by accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of the ones to be there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you have to be a disabled person.
We go for <unk>
Christmas marketing are at the shopping center, drive in circles in search and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I say, I've got the 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There is a <unk> <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Muslim <unk> woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm in Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same first first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> me <unk>
If my three sisters. They were going to public school, my parents who went to the school system and were <unk> that I also was, and if we didn't take all the top note all of us had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactical thing that I was using was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would <unk> it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and <unk>
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were every family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and still every family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like campaign.
The people who grew up had no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so I saw the dawn at sunset very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> I'm crazy. It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy -- so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get rid of <unk>
On the summer holiday my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink <unk> milk on the back, and I was drinking warm cups on the back, and I was going to remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga I was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the <unk> tasks I took the top note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the <unk> of glass my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called a very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming about four <unk> "When I will end up with a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of <unk> At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> at the end of <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying and crying out, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me because they believed that I couldn't do the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the action stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for which it was literally born and they gave it to a actress without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disability for disabled paper.
When I graduated home, and my first <unk> tour, was as extra in a <unk>
My dream was made true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it went out there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that <unk> directors not <unk> actors, actors, with disability.
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took famous comics from New York to New Jersey to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she was at the bottom of the <unk> of New Jersey with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they find us quite fun.
In 2003, my mother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and at the time I remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma challenge.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was kind of invited to the <unk> news program, it has <unk> <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a graduate dance -- I went to a study and they sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I'm clinging to the <unk> to not go off the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like I was able to <unk> and beat my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl and a little girl.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips in line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease is there?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with the media, but I don't think that <unk>
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that I think -- less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need the whole society to teach well for our kids.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet of <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity to give young refugee kids in Palestinians -- a tiny little bit of what my parents were telling me.
It was the only time my father saw me performing live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no opportunity, there are no work, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing.
One day he gives him a gentleman who offers him to <unk> after dinner to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present a young guy.
He finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That little boy from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of opportunity, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunity, the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of 2.0.
And in my city of birth, they <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I had ever seen forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house a young leaders at a business degree.
<unk> to about 90 leaders juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a <unk> of ideas about the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because it was a graduate student, frustrated, was the perfect white <unk> for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> civil war, have destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the spirit spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people will be the creators of the economic opportunity that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business <unk> and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers that are <unk>
For those who grew up in civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for weddings -- creating gardens in the homes, and the companies in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where young families, the young families, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They were doing business solutions for local problems.
So I will inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit -- but the young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and put it in the way of their business.
They encourage the young people with the resources that they need, and they need support that need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park Park in the <unk> is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and maintain the bikes for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and they eat their <unk> innovation and they will have more stories about the Peace and Parks of <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the middle of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not because of the way we were going to be able to pretend we were the first human beings in step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed of the shed had a <unk> of about four square feet with hearts -- <unk> <unk> balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy as to get what they had been doing, who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and you would get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> is the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through their routes and I interviewed people in the offices and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks.
And operated the mechanical mechanical and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still getting rid of the weight of getting on their body -- a whole metric of the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Bureau <unk> the collection of waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass by <unk> around.
They just want <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
And I also learned about how the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves come.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of waste efficient and effective every day, this starts to <unk> of their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real forms.
We had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy are starting to fail when it's on the danger of the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out the relationship.
And then this is what I call our average average speed necessary.
I mean, I mean, just at the speed of that we used to move in the <unk>
We usually don't get rid of <unk> and we carry on with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that perhaps help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in the street <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his <unk> journey as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing this particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Little after that, I started looking at the collection of waste and I came back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together, and we got good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and to account at all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
Water waste, what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, they will give you a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you -- thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center for several stories in the capital of Addis markets, <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a weather where it is about 20 to 25 degrees over the year.
And in third place, it looks like nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> that's been so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure of the <unk> where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries from the building.
And this spreads out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that would lead to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of concrete with <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystal crystals that use the inner light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what we <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center of the commercial center because there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to put on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is in a set of collecting water for the indoor <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the building floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big, big project, the biggest thing I ever have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a <unk> wall with access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and create 12 early blocks in size and characteristics that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I would take a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and forth and make activities like a race of two kilometers in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people are changing the communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a target to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up with that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I was left time after the school, I was a little later and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took from the table of my teacher to the grades.
And then I did.
And I took those ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the same thing.  And I brought back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them up to every line of <unk> and I just got a row out there, just because of being there, since I was there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get <unk>
It was that everything was <unk>
I never got <unk>
But most of all, I was given the reason why I thought about this little girl, so small to <unk>
They gave me the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates.
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause one of <unk> <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study the <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no reason that if there was no <unk>
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't be <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
It would have no light.
<unk> the high school lists -- because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy, no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers to everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost that has all of them.
This year will be spent 100 years of their work -- <unk> <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> -- my God, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of the <unk> right?
We think in a kid trying to reconcile to sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forget about how radical it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the tiles that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a well-known narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details are going to do to <unk> the <unk> right?
The <unk> are doing all of <unk> <unk> and that is something that I was trying to understand.
Everything that she makes for me to give me pleasure to each other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fully cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break into it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
This is why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> very well in the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's these scientific research with true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to need, and it makes us suffer, causes us in us a much deeper and vital range than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement of us <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at such a <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that her woman would <unk>
And Freud said there was something strange in that man, that he didn't get away in what his wife was doing.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely we are, we are, more we become the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, are bringing us to make violent acts of violent <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since that was sent <unk> to itself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to convince her to the new girlfriend of his former parents, I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big even though it gets creativity. Right? Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to make them <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, it can be <unk> in a second.
Take the most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to pick up from your own and <unk> of what you have to get on and it is under the floor, you get on the floor, you get your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as long as I want to go.
It's a shame, because we live at a time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good for social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal designer.
But I've always said, <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius -- but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute is the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
Could it even be that easy?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction embrace jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> he invites the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo line of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest decline in peace days in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon NASA's spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a couple of 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and U.S. agencies.
They died people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
He walked on his surface, which was convicted of <unk> death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we find?
They didn't brought up a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some people ask why the <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And they might also ask, why scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why is he playing Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> of the <unk> was not just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the power of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, but in 1969, the crew crew crew flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being went back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than Apollo <unk> 10, and the optimism of the power of technology has been <unk> by the power of technology that we imagined that technology would solve the technology as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure cancer, or feed the world's population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So it happened to do that with our ability to solve problems with the <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard that over the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would be like the technologists had <unk> and they had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the selling <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation for us in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which they get <unk> and Microsoft, Apple and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says markets are <unk> <unk> incentives that venture capitalists provide entrepreneurs with business.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas by funding the funding for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at its high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred little investments with small investment investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a massive capital and that development is in the long term. They haven't invested in the development of technologies intended to solve great problems because they don't have a proper commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic and the reason.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of energy energy sources that can compete at the price. They don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of a self-driving energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political policy that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know that famines are a result of failure in the food trade.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are the policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can make things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have been found effective and effective treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to fix the problem: the institutions must support <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it has those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's not a popular science mythology as the way of exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> the ideas that are about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, is a very general belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turned to think that it may have declined in some activities or institutions that might have increased others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago still being quite <unk> and there are nurses.
The rest are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the way.
But it's that evidence enough?
What American opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people would spend when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone else asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably <unk> by asking, "What does what?"
And that would be a very scary answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official, and the guy or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all of those.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary school teacher I know to give the class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why leave it from side to all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to embrace the good judgment of the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the aim for me to <unk>
And I was going to get more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> that is the right target.
Once you tell you that he says, yeah, OK, that means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trust it, because it's going to be worth living.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will be able to get your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we are going to move back before trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so on, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will be going to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we will argue that the system of accountability -- that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
It would take all of that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trying to be worthy of trust, and we will tell the people that we're reliable and if you choose to determine whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
So let's go to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in short, is a defining thing because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because of course, you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to give you some <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, the ordinary people -- the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
And the store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving explanation
I take them and return it to me and get them back to the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worth confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone and more and more and more and more of them today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
They first created this tool that gets back into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the transfers is their physical body in the pixel at the West.
Designers can break their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How can you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill <unk>
In the Science divide of Microsoft, with Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a <unk> bombsight with the depth of depth to detect the fingers and the face, now you can put the hands of the keyboard, get into the inner space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and <unk> lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there are down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information to us?
We had a lot of us have bought and returned by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is an online <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make them physical in the way that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator, <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This <unk> magnet, it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can be able to be physically <unk> and a distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience, that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital data is not only going to show you something that will begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to get ourselves in our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's our imagination.
Thank you.
I was amazed to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a accurate way to the <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if I would like work or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera village.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were passionate about, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
You know, for the rest of my life -- a second class happiness was the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
No one to me around me -- OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> I gave the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I was here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not <unk> a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my reading habit habit
They have a lot of perspectives.
For example, the beginning of this map seemed to me because this is what students are in China learning.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's a lot of research camps as a comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading work worked for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a very <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, this is through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to feel like <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion, of where the passion is coming from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So, the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a PhD student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came up to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw up on the couch of my office and he grabbed my shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought the <unk> made me easy only to move the head while I get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work later, she got home later, he has children later, even the death goes on.
For <unk> like Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, you would be <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they would be, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk> <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to age old without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the age of 35 years.
It means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and experiences and moments that they give him a way to your life have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in more of 40, we don't trained to panic.
This audience will be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or being coming out of their own future 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> to the <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the 28, to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk> time.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> were <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you pat a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It doesn't happen.
They stole that person to that person and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> smart, interesting people like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship is not even killing the time."
Or they say, "All people say that while I start a race before 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point about the '30s, became the music and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think that I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit extreme, but you don't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on 30 and so many of them start a career, choosing a city, and having two or three children in a much longer period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful doing all of a time to <unk>
The middle-aged business crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
You realize that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often involved in our <unk> but then she gets up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, a day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
And I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to take care of whether I get <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as a little bit of sitting at the time that I was sitting on, the Emma <unk>
So, for the next few weeks, I said to Emma three things that every single man or a woman deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that was <unk> from that identity crisis, and <unk> identity.
For capital capital. I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this:
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try to try to try and try to try from it.
I'm not <unk> exploration exploration, I'm <unk> exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the passwords that get together with friends with minds that are similar to what you know about who you know, what you know how you think, how they think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of his circle.
The new things come from what they are called the weak <unk> friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half -- no, and the weak ties are the way to <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs that we have never been <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as she said, Emma soon would be <unk> in her family, when he has a couple and a form of her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit down than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when all on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with whoever is that you will get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a prime of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped her get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave his boyfriend, with a living thing.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> of events in museums.
This married man who elected <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I sent up a letter that said, "Now the space of emergency networks are not <unk>
And the story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even 25 and even 25 and a good conversation, a good deal of TED can have huge effects in the years or even the next generation.
This is my idea that to spread all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital capital capital -- use their weak connections, choose your family.
They don't stop to define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job in management training for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to show you mathematics to graduate students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I give you tasks.
When I went back, I went back to grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance don't have <unk> I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not doing so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a kind of perspective on a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
Is it the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to be further away from competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really hard neighborhoods working in really difficult neighborhoods, which teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of the learning of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, wondering, what about these marketers are going to keep their head work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts. It emerged a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good <unk> the physical health and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is having resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my <unk> <unk> and then I waited around a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination -- they had significantly greater likely to get even when the <unk> in every single feature that I was able to measure, things like family income, the results of the test testing, even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development <unk>
What should I do to teach the kids a robust ethical <unk>
How do I keep it for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going to go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly not related to whether or it's even related to <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that we developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows on the answer to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was amazed at this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new approach and quickly learning can be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy to understand it.
The first 200 will enable you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> traffic cues -- understanding the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it might be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like I was screaming <unk> <unk> I am <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> these eight characters.
They are building blocks to create a lot of characters.
One person.
If someone walks behind, that's <unk>
As the old one, two is company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a weather as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- from remember, because a tree agent is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two everything together, it gets very hot.
Three all together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Was there someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women, <unk> is <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred and lots of characters, which is the same thing as you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire.
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning because Japan is the east of China.
So one sun next to place, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked up on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my favorite movies when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and bring a magic wand, and take a show.
But by looking at that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We are now living and we raised our children in a kind of industrial <unk> a computer <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy to a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies used by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician magician is that the most educated characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to see this when I made "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  And so she was married in the room and stayed impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
It would have a sense that Luke is one to an army for overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician of <unk>
How do he win his movie?
To do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to grow up with it, and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much free capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the way of bricks and <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by the experience that princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who would have been <unk>  I think at the time of the first February, I really expected them to start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus to defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and I'm talking to the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they kids, they're not really your target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against <unk> but they don't necessarily show the guys how to defend from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of every time is still going up with classic <unk> every one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he came back.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted and already <unk> but maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book guy, and in the '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There's only three questions that should be <unk> in the movie, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid you like.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet we rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success to <unk> a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think it's going to be <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it a lot of the film happening in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> with violence and then pick up the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this statistical statistic and we want to get it to you.
We have tools to our available as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to do that, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> -- if, at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing radically.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, which was his favorite Star character. Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What have these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I would tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where her work was to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I liked was to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would give you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1,300 kilometers of length and <unk>
And my sea department had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake, it suddenly looks like <unk> pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of old art <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, Nile <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, and it covered all the city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians and Egyptians doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for human <unk>
Five feet below a thick thick layer of skin, we found a dense layer of objects of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> of the occupation of several hundred years coming back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, of the Middle Empire of these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Roman Empire.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would take a place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians with satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle East, it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the highest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the <unk> for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that it's made.
And now they <unk> a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing on a racing race of bicycles and they're in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They are strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide with the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying all over the parts, wheels on the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the door.
In the lobby, to the hall, or what there is to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
From his chair, on a brown horse,
It's a horse that speaks speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> by making them tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you spend that it's about getting into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
And already in the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on the center of the center, singing <unk> One <unk>
Now I go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a kind of yellow bricks and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping for you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago a few years ago, hoping that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different men and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
I had whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old old techniques invented by a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches and that medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I hear this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English -- and he said, <unk> you are an American <unk>
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of cards -- live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why don't it work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how to point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> disciplined memory and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time, people would invest in their memory, in order to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would argue that they have changed as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this kind of competition as unique of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College invited a group of memory trips, the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a computer battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of memory memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a functional MRI machine, you get their brains while they <unk> their brains and shapes of <unk> they found that in memory champions you get out of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as a armed race where each year, someone has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, I face -- there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who he's about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
A half hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> all of the techniques that are used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the ultimate <unk> paradox says this: I say two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> -- there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> What do you find?
The person who told him that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really does not mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories I dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They do well when they get home to work.
You probably get some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet named <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a good party, they didn't bring to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up foot, he <unk> her poem by memory, and he was going, and so soon it was, the classroom of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stood outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting next to me.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have a visual memory and very exceptional space memory.
If you asked them to tell you, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse and brown agent in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to know -- the more crazy -- the more crazy -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk> be.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do this memory, the same way that I had done it, if you had been invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely <unk> image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>
And that would remember you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then it falls into the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they spoke would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So it's like <unk> speakers <unk> their speeches -- no word for word, that you're going to confuse but, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> it would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw that this was just a fascinating thing, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory, and I had the idea of writing something great about this <unk> of <unk> competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event, boring.
And seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before sit at the New York Times, trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is actually about to do is better <unk> more and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> <unk> covered with tape just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor of a memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize speeches and phone phone phone phone and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just such a tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a <unk> gift but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
It was a kind of deep processing -- a kind of full care kind of attention that most of them is not going to be solved by there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I want to leave you with today, is what I think -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks up to our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life you must be from the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so we can only take a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony who gave the living room.
And there were all the time I looked at the television, so every time I was coming out of my room to the bathroom, and I was going to see me and I would go back in a towel -- all of me just looked at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not to <unk>
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not about these <unk> but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture tells us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection. We've used this trick for a long time a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> it has this round thing, columns, <unk> red <unk> which <unk> is about communicating with this <unk> children, the ownership values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both -- libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side, the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to do it and we tried, we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is why you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to the other side of those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we are all happy, so we started to experience from <unk> we do <unk> back and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We took the pendulum again in the other direction.
We took those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> and we add a bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> they won on audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to French or the Italian or the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we also have memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we have new design techniques that we have a computer design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> a little bit of ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is a academic and <unk> and it's <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and academic and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public in general, they were completely agreed about a building.
New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased two and a half percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous in the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created a emotional reaction with these shapes.
The main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of beginnings of the new millennium happened with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they had to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast, as architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design 2, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, <unk> because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel and the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until they will be in both extreme extremes of <unk> and we can actually be able to make the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked at exactly the whole product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come up and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a communication medium, because these are not only images of a building, are the images that one made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks telling us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other about architecture, because digital media not only have changed the relationship between us, but they changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think of a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there is no only answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't accept something that I haven't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't get rid of the <unk>
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to another movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> of red brick in ideas that should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do sport or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream in the East Side of New York, and a half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe you.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we formed our kids, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he already started walking.
And it makes it very great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that we like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself the <unk> big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all their friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, when did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite what his mom tells him all the while she's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow school colleagues say, you don't know who believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to stop a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenage teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life of their most vulnerable life of life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it bringing to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of people who liked to have and the kinds of comments they get.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is to be tested.
What is the most prominent thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from girls right now.
<unk> zero remain <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are you?
But kids are not immune to this.
Just like the superheroes around the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their look, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls is not doing something because they think they don't look at nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as humans and as <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of every three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not attending classes at all the days when they don't feel comfortable with it.
And in the business season, if you don't think you see you good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you get a note lower than the average of your fellow who don't care about that way.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gives you regardless of what these young people are.
So in order to be good of course, we're talking about how you're really seeing you.
<unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, involved in more diet that they can take them to a food mess that can take them.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what you make <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, dieting surgery aesthetic <unk> sexual relationships at early ages and no protection and harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of if they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follow our children are not only going to have a positive impact but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical points for any willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is a difference, but deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
By challenging the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children grow to grow all their person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be them out of the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think they have never seen the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is at two seats distance. What would it mean for her if you were liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he would give him for not having a long long, <unk> belly -- <unk> <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were doing this to be able to unlock this and free advantage of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> to us.
But let's bring our kids the truth.
And I think the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and that really is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They encourage self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of an age of age today, will become more insurance agents in the way tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
They were initially initially like that, but I was imprisoned by other charges -- in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't be taken away.
Later they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> American <unk> teacher from elementary school among the two made the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we have to use all the possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he sat down with me and a few friends, had been going to training on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got my father <unk> my father helped me sustain the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to the target for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot gave him a little bit of orange light on the goal and for surprise of all, especially mine, all the goal on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
Of such father, such son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a van <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved back 20 times, and that instability during my childhood was not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone in a time of packing and going to another city.
As long as I was always me the new face of the class often was a victim <unk>
secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the white. But it's going to be the new part of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going to spend the time reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have developed social skills, to put <unk> <unk> and grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was pleased with opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like your race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way of thinking, was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids had done friendship, was Jewish one.
I took a number of days coming out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before had had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay players there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the simplest and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a little boy, I developed a sense of empathy for suffering from others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people exactly the way I wish I would be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me of a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be a homosexual but I know what is going to be done for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart was making me honest with my <unk> and it helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of ways he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that keeps in my heart for always, while it's alive.
She looked at me with <unk> eyes of someone who suffered enough with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that somebody else is to try to get the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way than even though I was giving myself this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to get myself <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, and the loss and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk about that <unk> acts -- like rejection of my dad.
With this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.
At this moment, there is a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound, and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
Is your body, your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like a time of your childhood coming in front of your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything at work.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film -- you, and you and you.
There is nothing to be <unk> more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware, anything in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films, <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective in objective of it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
<unk> psychology was studying behavior -- the neuroscience is studying the brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years, was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of great work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to me by saying that this kind of work in neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> internal movie there.
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do you operate the <unk> how do they work, how they are <unk> how are the <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, and they're all questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about how we speak, how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> of heart.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we will tell us at this point.
We have a wonderful challenge, and we have used to this, the physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were in the beginning of <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the Earth's subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what we need to do, is to explain the functions -- the behaviors of the brain and the brain -- and it studies everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to just denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that we have, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as <unk> space, space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, it looks fundamental, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of fundamental concepts space, time, <unk> government laws -- and then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- very long, time, mass, but then it is -- then for a matter of logic, you have to have a <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it was suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws and the laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, time, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want to do very fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find exactly fundamental laws that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons is smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when I think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling -- some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think about something that <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's a lot less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more <unk> with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that are going to address thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there are information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple information.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of integration integration -- which is called <unk> which measures the extent of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's one degree of information integration -- just as significant as significant of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of different than zero.
In fact it represents a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the below.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, consciousness is that he puts fire into the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences to be quite serious.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that I think, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what it matters in ethical terms, and <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has an integrated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are these really serious ethical problems about the ethic of development systems of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for conscious collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated group, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk, an internal film for this whole whole group of TED, different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
And I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is the second thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait at night to the morning.
But I think we finally will be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low profile of education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, I would love with my younger sisters.
Everything was quite normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get a community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She has actually no <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching a high school in a high school of <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the 11th class of studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you get your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as inspiration objects.
And we don't. And it's not the <unk> of the boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage stage, what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability, in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or is this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without your hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because they went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for a very bad thing to be my life, could be worse.
I could be that mark.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the numbers of the number of times that I've been talking about, strange <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was going to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images of the people with disability at the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
There are some things.
But the things we rely on are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called to the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of society in which we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as you do it, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of common.
They are simply using their bodies by getting the best of their capability.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way that we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I didn't realize that I'm lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious, trick of how to load the mobile phone battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that has been sold to us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability, in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is the lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stairs has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not do the <unk> for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all of those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered no <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't be <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because reality is augmented reality to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a hull and know what is running through the game of the game of 160 <unk> the blood beating the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to do it with everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So you know, some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the shell, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to a feeling to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players -- and they've been asked by YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we took it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The Rift Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian roller <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I was born, a <unk> video crossing across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be able to be <unk> running the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or do you take a stick on <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles away, like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to the reality <unk> <unk>
You know, <unk> reality -- the augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief role on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl, that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> of the <unk> of the field and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see your next show in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want to because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate losing <unk>
If you miss <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner corner having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sending you to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good guys of bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being only for nerds.
It's also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
They brought to a wide receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight is going to tell you that a <unk> behind you is going to <unk> it doesn't <unk> but the system of <unk> <unk>
They were going to be able to get to the area of protection.
Another <unk> you realize that there's a <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in their bombsight as an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
And I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the countryside,
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for.
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much this technology is worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives as a <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
Recently I was introduced after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the southern tip of the county of <unk> County -- which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden Gate was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer head to build the bridge, said that "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such as it frees you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body carries against water about 120 miles an hour.
The <unk> impact is <unk> and some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them are dying in impact.
The ones that don't normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that are <unk> this suicide method will be given to the death of the death that they are <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel into the bridge.
This is where most people have before they take away their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young woman was talking to an officer looked at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but as officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, medical officials and psychologists trained new government to speak.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on September 22 last year to receive a call from a possible subject subject to sit on the <unk>
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an officer of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years and had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the great family was called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason <unk> they had asked him.
<unk> damage will affect a lot of people.
I propose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it.
What do you find?
<unk> what does it mean?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels because they probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances you've thought about ending your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and that they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home, talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but I appreciate a lot more moments from realizing that Mike didn't really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police officer and the <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental disease.
It must not be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go out ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a single suicide subject on the front sidewalk near the center near the northern tower.
I took my breath down the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the hour and the next half of that, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his account back to this lane back to that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up to the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was he did that he did that was <unk> and gave him the hope and life else <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "Can I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11 o'clock events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness which has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like <unk>
We thank God by you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> -- when I visited the General San Francisco at San Francisco at night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
And that act, despite finishing his own pain, stealing the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people -- or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Usually this is achieved only from three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Those incidents I've been directly involved in between, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked to him about an hour.
During that time, I was going to get my hand on three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the railing <unk> the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge is not just connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be able to do this to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but on your inner you know what you are, and a question will tell you, "How do you get into that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone at all.
When I became a model I felt that eventually had achieved the dream that had had since a child.
My outside of the end of <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones I'm going to go back later, when I look at this photo, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my <unk> agent ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I was introduced as a <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why always take that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never love to share my story, not because I thought that being bad, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being woman.
I have mama, and my family who accept me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me: This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing of man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> <unk> competition.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in suit and won in <unk> and he was a third finalist between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was from Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they <unk> the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you're going to join the U.S. and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to age 19,
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most <unk> and safe surgeries in it.
In the United States, it was necessary to have surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity card, means power or power to get a <unk> but for me to be the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who was living in his truth, but he said, <unk> end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20 of November, we do a global <unk> for the Day of <unk>
I am on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha memoirs, P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day there's no more <unk> than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first of all, thank you with all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family -- who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women, young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called and a few times, when I was called, and he told me that his parents could not accept it, and I would call my mom and say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other no. It's just identity identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all have assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the theme that sometimes that task doesn't block, and there should be a space that would allow people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you.
In many tribal societies, and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who was known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcoming by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes up, day their <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot of a little bit of a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, you get sad.
When it comes to light to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only has any mother suffering, but the daughter was <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school raised her brothers.
Until 12 years old, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you get out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that assumption honor, the one could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male male members from the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and her happiness from his sisters in behalf of honor.
And there's a more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and women's decisions even if they don't want to.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if you get it with an old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young has to follow it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his kids.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, and sisters, when I was born <unk> and believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so before I was going, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and I called my daughter so so.
But when I <unk> all of these were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried out when she grew, when I was four and a half years old, I was the <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the child's life.
<unk> in a school means recognition and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they'd be able to go to school, two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of Canadian Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school and girls and children in the way.
I used education for <unk>
I taught my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and they were able to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
Musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people killing and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, I was lifted up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a day for the BBC, of BBC, he was offered her myself for New York City Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and 9 a.m., of 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would tell me to the ear to my wife  "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
They put your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital, and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut out, I used to see a dark shadow that was held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my <unk> smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give me good. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when you didn't have his task.
They fight with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I'm telling you not what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google <unk> <unk> -- where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before joining Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain <unk>
Are you still just like smart or not?
It doesn't be like that, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And then after the operation, I had to decide what a dozen take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
More than I have saved by recently.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the fatal dose, because there's really no one map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with different mixes -- and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the <unk> dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly controversial case for a few months, I was able to run out and typical chemicals for a man in night, and I was surprised by looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all of the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do is they have to be better at the men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk> of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference, how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see the things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are many discussions about how the minds works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for thinking <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> and really <unk> very sophisticated and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take a quick quick of these mental imagery from my mind to the computer screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups that have been done by two groups that have been done by two groups that are leading to neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you're going to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into brain fields, <unk>
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were <unk> their brains to create a great pool of reactions from the brain to video sequences.
Then they showed them a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information scanning to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew up us.
We're right near doing it.
We just need to make resolution.
And now remember that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain, the same <unk>
This was conducted with the brain scanning systems of the major resolution of available resolution today, and its resolution to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce you to get there.
I didn't give you that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way we know.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but to this point, magnets <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than magnets -- we make better magnets better.
We can create structures much more complex with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make some really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in the <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio frequency <unk> in the MRI systems.
At their time, instead of a Canadian magnetic field, they are <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns going into the frequencies of radio radio.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns -- we can actually increase the information that you can extract in one single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide into layers our growing knowledge of the brain structure and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity. This is sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas into direct the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go on top of the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease.
We have a little more options than open this door.
Anyway, you pick up a year in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you this night about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay lifestyle.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe to tell any person for the first time you love it or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
And so I'm all a tough conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet a universal thing.
It's fear, and it must happen.
A few years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I would be slope by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had <unk> my head -- I would ask myself, normally a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father was like, <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would say anything, and I would go through it.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took it deep down, and I went down to my back to my back and back a little girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for an <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so it took a deep breath, again, I stood up on <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a little bit messy.
I have the short hair like a boy, and you saw clothes, but I am a girl, and you know, as you know, you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all of it, they only said, "Oh, you are a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet it's not different from yours or yours or yours.
I would give you a hundred reasons for why you get out of my closet it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard not to <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who declared in banking banking is harder than he said it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder than saying to your five year-old child that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop thinking about what is difficult for us to make it feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least security than what the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a closet it's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian lesbian to fight any kid in four years to get the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my mom gay, and the moving only muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my young strangers who I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> you will kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> lady in my black dressed in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally got to one where my friends were my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women, I screamed at <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you had ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for desperately to show your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you will be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you can do.
It's like the hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be able to know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they would maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can get injured safe, so they have done, but you never talk about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you might feel <unk> but that one in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark Eve, a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater question can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computer as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental fundamental mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a space race that you know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the <unk> of the Earth, but they have amazing telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that does not know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept of Earth's intelligence on Earth, you'll see it forced to develop a physical theory that explained to a certain time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in a robotic movement planning has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex tasks.
And so, by taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, from a number of years ago: there is a <unk> mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force -- degrees that acts with the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to maintain the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future diversity -- but to an impending time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so, having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How clever is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it arises from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long term in any system where they find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the idea of doing that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is to have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technology.
This ability of use of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite extremes of one rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable into a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where their friends are constantly constantly keeping the network of the connected net.
This same capacity for network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to extend the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> of <unk> <unk> and successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk of risk management will have huge applications in finance, in <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from a single equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So back to the beginning of the use of the term of the term -- the <unk> labor, there was always the concept that if you were using smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion there.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all the concept of rebellion in the way the other <unk>
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all contrast, that the impulse to take control of all the future possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of the intelligence, the general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets to get out of this kind of <unk>
So my equivalent of that statement to happen to the descendants of <unk> to help them build artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence -- the intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the top of the stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Over the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which orbit about other stars, what the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that you get to.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that receive from their own <unk>
At once, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of virtual worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from the millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on on a global scale, have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientific scientist in the weather, and I don't know.
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission, take samples of the atmosphere <unk> and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offering not only short flight flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But despite the fact that all of these images, we can remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the hardest places and the highest of the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen, by our tropical forests within thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of enthusiasm for Mars and other planets will drag up with a big and sad <unk> the implication -- the implication and the belief that Mars will hope for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
And so I like the <unk> exploration, I'm on deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say Mars will be there in order to help humanity is as a imagine that the captain of Titanic Titanic will tell us that the <unk> will actually have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and climate preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
<unk> environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment called the <unk> paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked, has to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is protecting the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table where I had <unk> them.
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get in, and it was cold.
I couldn't get home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because I had an early flight Europe to the next morning and <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I was going to be a good stopped.
I am neurologist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> the heart rate goes up to your heart rate and <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in its place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least if bad things happen, you know, the probability of a total catastrophe happens.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that he broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then it tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious.
In the house, we would take a place for the things that you lose very easily.
This sounds common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the important things, where the same thing is, where the fish are, where the <unk> trees are, where the female tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, <unk> and <unk>
So at home -- a place for keys, a hook along the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular crate in a particular way.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with that stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of the cellular card card cards -- passport, <unk> by email themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
